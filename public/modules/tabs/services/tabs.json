					"longDescription" : "Precog is reaping the benefits of connected complex machines by providing early, accurate failure alerts, days in advance of the failure's predicted occurrence.  The solutions was selected by BASF SE (ETR: BAS) to protect its critical assets. Precog is also part of the GE Predix program and is offered by GE Power (NYSE: GE) to its customers. The prospect's pipeline includes several leading companies in the energy, steel-making and agricultural equipment sectors.   The software technology combines machine learning with physical and mathematical concepts.It basically enables the organization to build an additional layer of knowledge about the machine behavior that is blended automatically into the machine learning process. This technology is based on an open standard developed at the Technion in Israel (now ISO 19450).\nToday Precog is focused on predicting failures for industrial machines (chemical, power-gen, Oil&Gas etc). This topic is usually known as predictive maintenance.  We think that the most interesting future market for the company's product is the autonomous car industry.   We know for a fact that the technology will work there: we can predict engine and other parts� failures days in advance. We know that cars will be connected and that the data will be available.   We don't know if there is a business case for predictive maintenance for autonomous cars.   The group will need to learn the autonomous car market and evaluate:  1. Is there a value for predictive maintenance in this future market / 2. who is the customer and what is the business case (who owns the car, who operate it, who cares if it breaks unexpectedly...). / 3. What is the business model- software company\\service company. What is the right pricing structure. / 4. Future competition and potential players in the market. / 5. Marketing and Sales strategy and timing - who should be our partners? are they into the topic now? what conferences we should attend? who are the opinion leaders? / 6. build a conceptual budget for penetrating this market.  The results (if the analysis will indicate that this market is attractive) will be used by Precog to apply for government funding for this specific activity.  The group will gain knowledge and expertise in one of the most interesting markets today, a market that attract anyone from Google to Apple and Tesla.",

					"longDescription" : "Veed.me is a video production marketplace that connects marketers who need videos, with a global community of videographers.  Veed.me's clients include Fortune 500 companies, as well as earlier stage startups.  \nVeed.me has an office in Tel Aviv and another office in New York City which focuses on sales and business development.    \nBackground to challenge: We founded Veed.me about 4 years ago with the vision of connecting people who needed videos, with a vetted community of videographers around the world.    When we started, we thought our product would fit all sorts of SMBs, including brick and mortar businesses (i.e: little shops, restaurant etc..) because we knew that anyone who has online presence, needs a video.  After 2 years of working on many projects we found the SMB market a challenging space for a number of sreasons:  - They do not have large budgets   - their LTV (life time value) is low  - They are not educated enough about the importance of online video for their marketing efforts.        Accordingly, we have pivoted and re-focused on a different target persona, Marketers.      Marketers have a higher LTV than SMB owners.   -They run marketing campaigns  -They are educated when it comes to the need of video  -They have bigger budgets   They�re a part of a big community (marketersindustry groupsprofessional associations) where word of mouth can become a useful growth tool for us    BUT -  �marketers� is a very general term and can include many types of personas (marketers at an early stage startup, marketing agency, VP Marketing at a large organization, and etc.)    \nAfter working with many types of marketers, including: product marketing managers at big companies like Google, Agoda, Facebook etc.. we have narrowed down our dream persona:  The marketing person in the range of later stage startups (100+ employees) all the way to large organizations like Google.    Our approach to working with these types of companies is to treat them as �Enterprise Clients� and provide �White Glove� service (see attached deck). This means that they don�t solely use the online product, but rather, are assigned a dedicated project manager, who provides a more personalized and hands on service (only using our product to show different creators and examples when needed).    Based on feedback we received, Enterprise Clients like the following elements of our offering:   A - Quick turnarounds  B - Global reach (we have creators everywhere) - great for shooting testimonials or research videos like street interviews etc.  C - One point of contact    Based on these findings, we created this Enterprise page - https:veed.meenterprise    \nOur goal and challenge that we would like the assistance of the students is the following:   \nGOAL: Just like any other business, we would like to create stability and consistency with our revenuedealflow    \nCHALLENGE: We are lacking certainty regarding when and if our clients  will become repreat users.   Currently, each project is being priced individually, and then executed. But we believe our offering should be more intelligent and more clear (or standardized).  \nWe would like the students to develop us a comprehensive pricing model.    Although we are not a SaaS solution and each video is priced differently, we believe that there is a way to create recurring deals with Enterprise Clients for specific (or maybe not specific) types of videos.  If we have that, in addition to knowing what other needs such companies might want as a service, we can build an improved product, that will serve these types of clients.    We would also like the students to research and develop a method for the processes of engaging with enterprises. What are the main barriers of such companies to begin working with a vendor like us. (We do not reffer here to bureaucratic issues like becoming a vendor, but more about budgeting issues, quarterly plans etc.. )   \nAt the end of this research challenge we would like to know what the key elements that Veed.me should be offering enterprises are in terms of:   - Pricing models  - Ideal processes flow   - Ideal contact person (sometimes it�s not the person who holds the marketing title, but something related or around it)  - Which budgets videos are being taken from (Marketing? Research? Design? etc.)    Optional - preferred deliverables.  These findings will be crucial for our business development mapping and actions  \n",

					"longDescription": "Hexa is an automated virtual reality platform that makes it easy to create and scale 3D content. To date, 3D content creation is a costly, manual and time consuming process, reserved only for professionals using complex software. This is well beyond the reach of many companies seeking to access the AR/VR market.  Hexa addresses this gap by automatically converting low cost 2D images into flexible 3D objects. / Online fashion is thefirst sub vertical that the company has chosen to address. We aim to expand into other online sub verticals early next year (cunsumer electronics, furniture and home design).  Our fashion customers use our platform in order to create a virtual equivalent of their collections and display them in 3D. By doing so, they enhance shoppers engagement with a game like experience which improves key metrics such as conversion rate and time on site. Using 3D we are creating a stable uplift of 93% in our customers mobile conversion rate.  This is minimizing the gap between mobile traffic and mobile conversion which is one of the biggest online problems to date. Hexa is led by technical founders from Kenshoo, IronSource and AlgoTech and is advancing pilots with several global customers including M&S, American Eagle, Nike, River Island, Sears. \nBackground to challenge:\nThe complexity of Hexa's VR platform is not only technological. The most difficult part, that should always come before any development effort, is understanding not only your lowest hanging fruits and their current needs, but building your technology in a way that will be relevant to the market in 5 years time, while using the little resources a seed stage company has. When done correctly,  this can bind business and technology into successful and innovative companies.\nCatering our technology to the ever changing and developing needs of the market is becoming more and more difficult for two main reasons: \na. The platform itself is getting more and more sophisticated and can provide value to an ever growing list of industries. \nb. The VR, AR, 3D printing & 3D content industries are all very young with only one major use case - Gaming (and porn but it's off the table from obvious reasons). Since they are so young, have only one major vertical and the available research is basic, understanding how the old world should tap into its capabilities, requires a rare combination of ingenuity and creativity.\nThe challenge:\nConduct an in depth industry analysis on the VR, AR, 3D printing & 3D content industries and where they will be in 5 years time. Based on your analysis and research findings of where these 4 industries will be in 5 years time, make recommendations on how the company should cater its technology to meet those needs/trends and where we should focus our development efforst. In other words, develop a go-to-market strategy intertwined with product development strategy. (Once you have signed an NDA, we will provide in depth knowledge on our product capabilities to-date). Questions to address in your research include, but are not limited to:  - Who are the companies that will control these industries and what will social VR will look like in such a world. - Will 3D printing change the way we live and how can creating 3D content facilitate it's growth. - When will the gaming industry demand automation for its content creation and will it be possible to use smartphones to immerse our physical world with our virtual world (project Tango). \nThe mapping process is the most crucial part of your research since it will allow you to separate Sci-Fi from real technology (not an easy thing to do these days). Please keep in mind that the answers you are about to provide us will be used in order to build a better platform and focus our efforts on the highest expectancy verticals. It will have a direct effect on the way we prioritize our time and tasks sot has to be bulletproof. \nYou are about to enter a world with no limitation and little boundaries. A world where our childhood movies, dreams and desires are put down to the test and are manufactured by 1 & 0. Completing this challenge effectively will necessitate real out-of-the-box thinking and creativity. We invite you to our technological playground where everything is on the table and is a couple of clicks away from being real.         \n",

With its innovative technology and service, passengers can now deposit foreign coins and bills via TravelersBox kiosks directly into their e-wallets, online accounts, gift cards or make donations.   We enable customers to turn leftover money into digital funds.  The company currently operates kiosks in major airports around the world: Manila, Istanbul, Izmir, Ankara, Tel-Aviv, Milan (Malpensa), Bergamo, Georgia, Toronto and Tokyo.  Changi Singapore, Moscow, Russia are coming up next!\n\nTravelersBox aims to disrupt the travel industry by simplifying and improving the way we exchange foreign money and dispose of cash, in favor of digital funds. Our ecosystem is made of both traditional exchange companies such as Travelex and Western Union as well as more innovative players such as Global Exchange www.global-exchange.com and newer contenders such as Coindrum, Fourex, etc. Thus, while being part of the Fintech industry our business is strongly linked to the travel industry and specifically to the airports business landscape.   The company currently operates kiosks at international airports around the world and aims to dramatically increase its footprint to the top 25 airports of the world in the coming 18 months. In addition, the company is launching a second product offering the same service at Duty Free stores.   In order to successfully complete this challenge and understand this business, it is key to conduct a thorough competitive landscape of the related industries. Furthermore, students need to gain a good understanding of the travel industry, the main nationalities traveling around the world, their spending habits, cash vs. credit card spending, duty free behavior, etc.    \n\nThe Challenge   \nWe would like the students to tackle the strategic question of whether TravelersBox should be its own digital wallet, where customers can keep their funds to then be used with a variety of services and merchants, or whether we should strengthen our position as a platform to top-up digital wallets such as PayPal and continue being a reseller of major gift cards. This question is key as it will define the direction of our marketing and branding efforts, the relevant partners (Credit card companies, as oppose to gift card companies, and the company�s organization and focus.  This question needs to be answered in view of our recent growth into the Asian travel market. (We have recently added 2 leading Chinese digital wallets: Baidu Wallet and WeChat). \n- Should TravelersBox operate in the same fashion in Asia and other parts of the world? \n- Will a service that is tailored for the Asian travelers suit the American or European travelers and vice versa? This strategic questions will also determine if the customers depositing money are TravelersBox customers or actually customers of the various brands (PayPal, etc.).  \n\nWe are excited to be joining the iTrek program and have a team of MBA students tackle one of our key challenges that will directly affect where the company heads in the next few years and how it does it. We are looking forward to getting a fresh external view backed by new research and analysis.  \n",

Communication service providers rely on Amdocs to simplify the customer experience, harness the data explosion, stay ahead with new services and improve operational efficiency.        Our industry is changing at an accelerated pace. Customer behaviors and business models which were unthinkable 10 years ago are commonplace today. Technology innovations are being adopted at unprecedented scale and speed, particularly by over-the-top (OTT) players. If service providers can�t deliver a great customer experience, their customers will move to a provider who does. So there�s no time to waste.

This will include leveraging these technologies to improve and Support current channels, as well as to generate new services to be offered to customers.    2. Identify and analyze the current market landscape and developments, what are the business strategies and use cases by CSPs that incorporate these technologies. Provide real examples.  3. Provide Recommendations to CSPs � build a go-to-market plan, with recommendations to utilize AR and VR tech as new services, solutions or platforms for consumer and business customers.

Analyzing a brand new market.  As the counter-drone market - especially its civilian aspects - is an entirely new market, there is limited information and analysis that can be leveraged by us. Known potential verticals to consider include: airports, prisons, hospital (helipads), critical infrastructure, oil & gas, sports venues, IT datacenters, campus (enterprise, gov't) security, Hollywood movie lots, fire-fighting scenes. The challenge includes the following topics:  * Market size estimation (TAM or yearly) with growth potential  * Revealing more verticals with their relevant scenarios (privacy, smuggling, operations, public safety and more)  * Pointing out the verticals that are experiencing the biggest pain at the moment. * What are the legal barriers in drones mitigation using cyber means if any?   * What is the extent of measures government entities are allowed to enforce on rogue drones flying in sensitive sites? airports? prisons? which perimeters are allowed to legally mitigate drones?  * What is the extent of measures private entities - such that are not regulated under HLS or FAA rules - are allowed to enforce on rogue drones?  * What legislative measures are being taken by the federal andor state-level governments or are planned for the coming years? \n2. Pricing and Business model.  Taking into account the industry and regulatory analysis conducted, how much will a potential customer be willing to pay in order to keep drones out of a perimeter? What are the potential business models that can work well and what is the optimal one? Prices need to take into consideration the integrator markup (as in physical security installations, which are the ones usually doing the installation and on-site maintenance). \n",

					"longDescription": "Dynamic Yield's unified customer engagement platform helps marketers increase revenue by automatically personalizing each customer interaction across the web, mobile web, mobile apps and email. The company�s advanced customer segmentation engine uses machine learning to build actionable customer segments in real time, enabling marketers to take instant action via personalization, productcontent recommendations, automatic optimization & real-time messaging. Dynamic Yield personalizes the experiences of more than 500 million users globally and counts industry leaders like The New York Times, Europe�s fashion leader Lamoda, MakerBot & Liverpool Football Club among its many customers. Based in New York, the company has more than 100 employees in six offices worldwide.  \nDynamic Yield is a marketing technology offering personalization and customer experience solutions to marketers around the world.  Retailers, Media companies and B2C Marketers have adopted the technology rapidly in order to personalize digital experiences across all channels - web, mobile web, mobile app and email.    The problem with personalization today and how Dynamic Yield addresses it:    Personalization is a meta term in the industry used to describe the delivery of individualized experiences across all channels.    The easier way to think about personalization is to think about Amazon.   Amazon, which has set the gold standard for personalization, tailors its website, mobile web and mobile app based on each individual�s preferences, both declared as well as inferred.     Personalization has many components or strategies.  For example, when a customer visits a website, they expect the following:    That the site will tailor the first experience based on knowledge about where they come from (location, weather conditions).   And also based on the their past behavior on the site.   This requires that a vast amount of data from disparate systems to be brought together in order to create a complete picture of the customer.    Many aspects of the site can be tailored or personalized.   For example, the home page, the product pages, the check-out cart experience,  the content delivered, the products recommended, the messages that are delivered etc.    There are a variety of individual point solutions that address each individual aspect of personalization.  So, it is not uncommon for a retailer to Vendor A to deliver product recommendations and Vendor B to deliver personalized 1:1 messages.  Because customers are using individual point solutions,  the overall experience delivered to the end-user is disjointed.  Dynamic Yield addresses this problem by offering a single unified customer engagement hub which collects all available information and makes it really easy for the marketer to build, test and deliver individualized experiences.     \n\nThe challenge:    Today, personalization solutions are bought and executed by the Marketing teams.   So, the VP of Marketing, the CMO, the Chief Digital Officer and the VP of Merchandising are the typical business executives who seek, and implement personalization solutions.     \n# 1:  Change in who buys personalization solutions:  We, at Dynamic Yield, are foreseeing a seismic shift in the buyers who actually buy customer solutions.  Specifically, we believe that the adoption of a personalization solution will move away from the Marketing function and towards the Technology & Product Management function.    Simply put, the new buyers of personalization technologies will be the CIO, CTO�s and VP�s of Product Management.   \n# 2.  Build vs. Buy:  We, at Dynamic Yield, also anticipate that more and more companies will want to control their destiny when it comes to personalization.  So, instead of buying a 3rd party solution like ours, they will actually build various components of personalization in-house.   In the process of building such a solution, they will look for solution providers who provide API�s (Application Programming Interface) that actually breaks down the process of personalization to individual components and makes it easy for them to build personalization engines internally, on their own stack.    For example, a company might decide to:  Use an API that makes it really easy to collect all the data that a user generates on their site.   They will then take this data and incorporate it into their internal systems to develop a unified picture of the customer.    Using an API that gives them access to machine learning algorithms that make it easy for them to deliver the right product, content or offer to any user irrespective of their channel.    \nThe Assignment:    We would like to specifically understand:    What is the market opportunity for an API-led personalization initiative?  What percentage of the market is interested in a solution like this vs. the current approach of using a 3rd party vendor to manage personalization.    Who are the successful companies that have built and marketed API�s successfully.  What are the best practices in taking an API led solution to market? How does the marketing mix change and what are the channels to reach product managers and developers with API�s around personalization.     What does the market need in terms of Personalization API�s. What are the components of personalization that are most likely to be in-housed?  This, in turn, will determine our product strategy around the API�s we should build.  \n",

					"longDescription": "Shopic is an innovative self-checkout mobile app that enables an easy, quick and convenient purchase of goods from anywhere in the store � without having to wait in line. Shopic�s solution, already operational with some reference customers, integrates easily with any POS/Retail Management System. The retailer gains increased revenues, better customer satisfaction and loyalty, a direct channel for personalized sales/promotions and savings in operational costs. Retailers in the U.S. lose more than $14 billion every year from customers abandoning their purchase, due to long lines. Shopic solves this problem.\nShopic has a variety of solutions to prevent theft:\n� Every customer who uses the app must go through a specific location in the store, to receive a physical receipt. The transaction is completed only after the user took his receipt. This solution is based on Ultrasonic technology to verify the user�s location. In that location, the store can control the process and perform random checks.\n� Store employee app � an app that allows authorized store employees to see shopping carts in real time, including the customer details and the cart items.\n� Self tag-removal station � for RFID based security tags, the solution allows customers to remove their own security tags, but only from items they actually paid for.\nChallenge:\nThe challenge we would like the students to work on is finding the right pricing models for US retailers. Our solution has implications on different aspects of the retail experience. These implications affect both the customer and the store employees. This makes the entire sale process (from Shopic to the retailer) a lot harder compared to other services (for example, if someone sells a new security camera to the retailer, only the store security team needs to learn the new process).   Our challenge is finding the right pricing model that would help us in the sales process/go-to-market strategy. The student must take that into consideration as well, and think how the pricing model would structure the go-to-market strategy, and advise on the go-to-market strategy accordingly.\nThe pricing model needs to be both profitable for us and with a positive ROI for the retailer.  We are trying out different models all the time but we need help figuring out the right one, instead of simply trying different models on real potential customers.  From our initial research, retailers pay their cashiers anywhere between $0.2 to $1 per transaction in salaries, so we thought of maybe take less than what they pay their own cashiers and only per use (meaning transaction based model), but some retailers don't like paying that way.  In addition, when we send an offer to a new retailer, it includes the business model (pricing), integration cost and hardware (we have different hardware that we need to position in the store depending on the store type). For the hardware equipment, we need to find a good pricing model as well (should they pay upfront and buy it? Maybe lease the hardware from us? What's the shipping costs / taxes to import the hardware from China? Maybe we should manufacture the hardware in the US?)   A lot of work, research and thought needs to be conducted in order to learn exactly what the right model is, what other vendors are asking, what the cost of a \"card not present\" transaction is (from the payment gateway and the banks / credit card companies), and more.  If you choose to accept this mission ;) you will work with the company's CEO and VP product to learn more about the problem, our entire solution and sales process. \n",

					"longDescription": "Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Limited is a global pharmaceutical company, committed to increasing access to high-quality healthcare by developing, producing and marketing affordable generic medicines and a focused portfolio of specialty medicines. We operate in pharmaceutical markets worldwide, with a significant presence in the United States, Europe and other markets. As a world leading pharmaceutical company, we are strategically positioned to benefit from ongoing changes in the global healthcare environment.   \nWe operate our business in two segments:    \n �   Generic medicines, which include chemical and therapeutic equivalents of originator medicines in a variety of dosage forms, including tablets, capsules, injectables, inhalants, liquids, ointments and creams. We are the leading generic drug company in the United States and Europe, and we have a significant or growing presence in our ROW markets. We are also one of the world�s leading manufacturers of Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients (�APIs�).    \n �   Specialty medicines, which include several franchises, most significantly our core therapeutic areas of CNS medicines such as Copaxone�, Azilect�, Nuvigil� and Zecuity� and of respiratory medicines such as ProAir� HFA and QVAR�. Our specialty medicines segment includes other therapeutic areas, such as oncology medicines, including Treanda�, women�s health and selected other areas.      \nIn addition to these two segments, we have other activities, primarily PGT Healthcare, our over-the-counter (�OTC�) consumer healthcare joint venture with P&G.   We seek to address unmet patient needs while capitalizing on evolving market, economic and legislative dynamics in global healthcare. These dynamics include the aging population, increased spending on pharmaceuticals in emerging markets, economic pressure on governments and private payors to provide accessible healthcare solutions, legislative and regulatory reforms, an increase in patient awareness and the growing importance of OTC medicines.   \nIntegrating Home Monitoring and diagnostic solutions into the Teva business model:  Teva has been undergoing a strategic transformation to become a leading innovator in the pharmaceutical industry, extending its reach beyond developing and commercializing specialty and generic drugs, to providing holistic disease management solution for our customers.  As part of this effort, Teva�s Diagnostics and Personalized Medicine (DPM) group is actively seeking to develop or partner with solutions that enable the tailoring of treatment to the individual needs, characteristics and preferences of our customers.    To that extent, several home based diagnostics and monitoring systems (HBDMS) are assessed for synergy identification. An example of such technologies can be found in Cue.  In contrast to Companion Diagnostics, where a biomarker identifies patients who are likely to respond to a specific drug developed by a specific company, HBDMS are currently designed to measure markers that are not necessarily specific to a certain drug, but rather help the customer better manage their health.  While the business model for investing in the development of companion diagnostics and partnering on their commercialization is clear (due to the direct link to a specific drug), the business model for collaborating with HBDMS is not.  Due to the high value these solutions are perceived to bring to our customers in the future, and given that Teva has the largest medicine cabinet in the world, and is currently treating 205 million patients each day, DPM would like to identify a viable business model where HBDMS are integrated into the overall Teva offering.   Business challenge:  Identify a business model that will allow Teva to incorporate HBDMS into its commercial activities in a way that will generate �stickiness� to Teva�s products, and give us a sustained differentiated value proposition to our customers (patients, physicians, payers). \nSome questions and points to help guide you along the way:  \n- Understand the traditional Pharmaceutical industry's value chain and business model  \n- Understand the \"winds of change\" in this industry, key competitors, and new players entering the space  - Understand Teva (Therapeutic areas of interest, breadth of commercial capabilities and activities: OTC, Generics, PGT, Specialty, who are our customers, and the company's transformation process)  \n- Why, and how does Teva see potential to disrupt the current model?  \n- How can HBDMS fit in to the equation? \n - How can HBDMS offer our customers  a differentiated value proposition \n - Keep in mind that due to anti-kickback and inducement to prescribe regulations, Teva cannot provide the devices free of charge to  physicians or patients  \n- Teva�s current strategy does include selling devices to end users (this does not mean, that given an appealing business model that this will not change)  \n- View the HBMDS solutions as a platform that can be customized rather than a locked product.     \n",

					"longDescription": "CropX is an Ag-analytics company that empowers farmers to grow more crop with less water, using a simple, scalable software-as-a-service solution integrated with wireless sensors, that optimizes irrigation, applying different amounts of water to different parts of a field.\nCropX provides the world�s first fully-automated software-as-a-service solution that boosts crop yield and saves water, through Adaptive Irrigation - applying just the right amount of water to different parts of the same field. It is extremely simple to use, is inexpensive because it requires no capital expenditure, and is no-risk because it is a pay-as-you-save solution. \nCropX� underlying concept is based on the fact that land is not uniform, it is not completely flat and its soil structure is never uniform across a field. Virtually all current irrigation systems irrigate fields uniformly, thereby over-irrigating parts of a field and under-irrigating other parts; manually planning differential irrigation is not practical as it is highly complex, time consuming and requires expensive hardware investment. CropX is the world�s first solution that automates this process: it analyzes the field, and then automatically determines and applies daily just the right amount of irrigation to different parts of the same field. Our technology has been validated and demonstrating up to 30% water and energy savings and corresponding crop-yield enhancement, and has been published in multiple peer-reviewed publications. It is protected by robust intellectual property: our system is the world�s first and only solution that automates differential irrigation, and central elements enabling this automation are protected by our broad patent applications. \nFor the farmer our solution is revolutionary in its simplicity. The farmer simply downloads our app, places our sensors in the field in  Do It Yourself method, guided by the app. The sensors then communicate with the internet cloud, which performs power computing and generates a daily irrigation map and recommendations. The farmer reviews the planned irrigation on his smartphone, and modify it as needed. Once confirmed, our system sends the irrigation map to the irrigator, continuing to monitor its execution.\nCropX�s business model is two pronged: (a) generating strong subscription revenues from its tiered software-as-service offerings, and (b) leveraging our access to massive agricultural data to create longterm value using additional sources fo information. The sales are nased on a combination of selling the sensor itself and attaching to it a service package of diferend level of service. This model is similar to the sale of a smartphone in which one pays for the hardware and adds services to it. \n\n\n\nThe challenge\nCropx has just started to market its products in the US market and is looking to deepen its understanding of the market: the main points/tasks we would like the students to address are:\n� Market analysis � we have identified several potential market segments (based on type of the crops) that we approach. First we would like to review with the students if the markets we decided upon are defined properly. Then for each of these segments we would like to define the various attributes relevant to our offering and to fine-tune our specific offering is each of these segments. \n� Competitive analysis � the Ag-tech market is moving towards offering more sophisticated solutions cosists of various parts of our overall solution. The idea is of closing a loop between the measurement of various indicators from the field and the operating of the irrigation system (also called Pivot). We would like to review these solutions in light of our value proposition and differentiators. \n� Review and update the value proposition of our solution � this will be done first at the overall company level and then we would like to go into the various segments as we can see now that the requirements are different in each segment. As part of this task we will try to define future requirements for the next generations of our solution\n� Differentiators � the result of the two tasks above will allow us to better define our differentiators in the market and to improve our positioning\n� Messages � define our messages to the market and the appropriate means to convert these messages into the various segments we approach\n� Develop a Go To Market strategy � based on the market analysis we should define the Go To Market strategy with focus on channels. The agricultural market is in a way unique in some areas and penetrating it requires the use of the existing channels in a proper way. The channels may include: local dealers, national dealers, agricultural products chains, agricultural consultants, farmers� organizations and direct sales. As part of this effort we will review and update our pricing strategy: we will look into structuring the packages we sell (sensor and service) and define the right pricing  for each package/ solution.  \n",

					"longDescription": "Wiseshelf brings Real-Time insights to standard Retail shelves in traditional stores, enabling them to become a part of the IoT revolution. This allows visibility & communication with the shelf at all times. By doing so we can send alerts to the Retailer/Suppliers as the stock level decrease and avoid situations where shelves are getting empty. We can even alert the retailer that there are few items at the front (facing) of the shelf & that stock needs to be replenished. \nAnother topic is planogram compliance: The shelf area is the most valuable resource of the retailer & too many mistakes occur due to human error. We use colored LEDs at the front of the shelf to indicate the correct planogram to the store employees, so they can replenish the shelf according to the updated planogram. / Our mission is to use the store shelf as a platform for interacting with employees/customers in a variety of use cases:  Logistics & operation, Marketing & promotions, and creating valuable data that can be used by suppliers. Our solution is composed of two elements: Hardware -A modular, wireless IoT Shelf appliance that collects light sensor values and transmits via Wi-Fi  to the cloud. SW- a cloud based application that analyzes the data sent from the shelf and sends Real-Time alerts, recommendations & statistics to Retailers and suppliers. The shelf & the cloud are connected allowing a comprehensive set of interactive applications. \nPlease look at:   https://youtu.be/B9O02F4Hcfs \nOur first priority is to identify who our customer is: When we started, it was clear that the Tier 1 retailers (Target, Walmart & others) are the target. We later realized that the CGP suppliers have a similar incentive at minimum & they may be the ones paying for the system. So: is there one customer? two? a mix? / What is the ROI model for the retailers? the suppliers? / Can we charge extra for additional features such as better compliance to shelf planogram, better awareness to sales (flashing lights)? Can we sell the data we produce? / What is the ideal business model?  \nWe are an early stage startup , that has not started sales efforts yet. The basic commercial model we had in mind was recurrent revenues based on charging the Retailer one USD per product type (sku) per month. The logic behind this is: A typical grocery product costs ~$3 to $4 each. The retailers make gross profit of 25% to 30% which is ~$1. Therefore,  if the retailer is able to not lose the sale of only one item during the whole month, he covers his investment. On the other hand, various people claim that this means ~$4 to $5 per shelf per month, which is a lot of money for the retailer. They suggest that the CPG suppliers will put it at their charge in stores, agreeing with the retailer to act immideately as they get alerts.  So far we did not start selling the system; we only spoke with both retailers & suppliers & they both expressed an interest in trialing the system.\nImportant readings: \nhttp://www.nacds.org/pdfs/membership/out_of_stock.pdf http://www.acceleratedanalytics.com/blog/2012/2/6/calculating-the-cost-of-out-of-stocks.html http://www.businessinsider.com/r-new-target-coos-headache-too-few-goods-to-keep-shelves-filled-2015-8 \nhttp://mmibrands.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/True-Cost-of-Resets-Remodels-and-Other-Planogram-Changes.pdf \nhttps://www.thebalance.com/retail-planograms-2890336 / \nhttp://ca1.qualtrics.com/WRQualtricsControlPanel/File.php?Filename=conversion-stdy__mpaper.pdf&Size=2262933&Type=application%2Fpdf&F=F_3L5spcEfbRYrDFJ\n",

					"longDescription": "\nBeyon3D LTD.  \nFounded in Israel in 2011, Beyon3D is a leading a multidisciplinary building technology company, whose R&D team consists of mechanical engineers, aerospace engineers, material scientists, chemists, physicists, programmers, algorithmic developers, prototyping experts and architects. In November 2013 the Beyon3D team set out in its task to design and develop a new age robotic manufacturing system for the building industry.    Beyon3D aims to disrupt this multi-billion dollars - yet inefficient - construction market by introducing the first industry specific robotic manufacturing system, which enables a complete solution from design to manufacturing of building products: in simple or complex forms, in larger scale, in higher quality, in reduced cost and manufacturing time, eliminating the inefficiencies caused by common construction methods and human error, making existing prefabricated production lines and standard building processes on site obsolete.    Beyon3D brings the industrial robotics revolution to the construction market. Using a fully automatic robotic process, Beyon3D turns any 2D drawing or 3D model files into pre-fabricated building components, reaching micron-level precision at unprecedented production speeds, and at a fraction of the cost, compared to traditional methods.    Combining a specially designed proprietary software, tailor made materials, and a specially adapted 6 axis robotic arms, with its own unique hardware extensions, Beyon3D has developed an end-to-end file-to-manufacturing process that doesn�t require any coding or technical background, resulting in a fully automated process and zero manual labor. The process is simple, intuitive, and fast - a digital file of the component is uploaded to the system, and within seconds transformed into specific tasks for the robot. Using our own custom made building materials, the robot fabricates the component, while combining subtractive and additive manufacturing techniques.     With Beyon3D, developers, contractors, and manufacturers can dramatically reduce manufacturing costs, eliminate production errors, reduce waste, increase production output, and, for the first time, support any client custom requirement, including highly complex geometries.    \n\nThe Challenge  \nIn his book The Innovator�s Dilemma, Clayton Christensen made critical observations about established companies that lose significant market share to entrants with disruptive technology. However, most of the evidence indicates that it is a long and difficult process for superior new technologies to replace (or disrupt) the existing technological status quo.     Following 4 year of R&D, Beyon3D has completed its breakthrough technology and it is now in its final phases of implementation and beta testing. \n\nFurthermore, the company has already established a number of strategic partnerships with large market players with the intent to implement the technology in the following couple of years, starting 2017. Therefore, it is within this context that the students will support the company as it embarks in a preparation for a worldwide launch.  The students will develop a viable market penetration strategy that would leverage the company into a leadership position. In addition to the development of a strategic approach towards a successful market penetration and increasing brand equity, the students will identify the current market conditions and dynamics through a comprehensive breakdown of all forces affecting the sector:    1. Market Data analysis  - Market ecosystem  - Market leaders  - Spectrum of products, US market   - Products pricing   - Competitor business models  2. Go to Market Strategy  - Choice of initial products to be introduced to the market  - Business model and Pricing  - Strategic Partnership opportunities  - Process of production and lunching new products (in-house manufacturing/synergies & joint venturesB2B technology and materials direct sales)  - Development of US brand identity  \n\nBackground information:\nGlobal manufacturing companies spend millions of dollars on research, design and development of new technologies and products. The manufacturing industry is an innovation leader in terms of R&D and patents. These investments have resulted in rapid growth of new industries and manufacturing capabilities.   Despite its great potential innovation and cutting-edge are not words frequently associated with the construction & infrastructure industry, at least not in comparison to high tech industries, but even more unfortunate is that the industry�s poor image may be deserved. Data from analysts shows that the construction industry productivity has a long history of decline that continues today. While most other industries have undergone tremendous changes over the last few decades, the Construction & Infrastructure sector has been hesitant about fully embracing the latest technological opportunities, and its labor productivity has declined accordingly.     Perhaps the most acute problem in this sector is the traditional onsite work, which occupies the majority of the building construction process; workers still measure, produce, shape and assemble elements manually. Therefore, this longtime laboring process between design drawings and physical building still remains extremely inefficient.  A research conducted by Ghery Technologies (Leading building Technology company) estimated that within the global construction there is a lack of efficiency in the building process; 10% Materials are wasted, 30% of construction is reworked, 40% of the manpower is unproductive on job sites, 90% of projects are over budget, 40% of projects are late, leading to an additional 20% cost of the project production. The research concludes that contracting firms lose close to 45% of profits on write-offs that result from poor project performance. In the US market alone $15.8 billion is lost due to these inefficiencies.    To overcome these losses and waste, we are witnessing a global shift towards the industrialization and customization of this sector, with the implementation of advance technologies. Furthermore, many firms are focusing on the implementation of new technologies because of their belief in its potential to increase their revenues and to strengthen their competitive advantage. According to Deloitte & Touches Mid-Market Perspectives: America's Economic Engine report, technology has superseded talent acquisition in middle market firms with 70% executives surveyed saying that their productivity has increased due to improved business processes and technology developments. Firms that are unable to offer these concepts to owners are and will be at extreme disadvantage.  In addition to technology, another trend which is helping the sector to reduce waste and inefficiencies is the movement towards offsite construction. The principal behind this trend is the manufacturing and prefabrication of building components in a factory. After the completion of the manufacturing process, the components are transported to the site for a quicker building erection with skilled labor force.   In McGraw-Hill Construction latest survey report, Prefabrication and Modularization: Increasing Productivity in the Construction Industry, out of over 800 architecture, engineering and contracting (AEC) professionals, 66% report improved project schedules, 65% report decreased project costs, and 77% report reduced construction site waste.  When exploring the prefabrication of custom made building products, the Precast Concrete Product Manufacturing Industry is one of the most influential industries in the building sector. This industry comprises firms engaged in manufacturing concrete products. Industry production includes a broad range of products such as precast concrete slabs and panels, building boards, concrete roofing tiles, concrete railroad ties, concrete posts and poles, pre-stressed concrete beams and trusses, and ornamental concrete products. However, in this off-site construction industry building components are still produced through standard manufacturing processes, and therefore a limited spectrum of products is provided for those who wish to build faster, cheaper and more efficient.    Enter robotics period. The automotive, aerospace and ship building industries have gained an extensive knowledge in digital manufacturing techniques along the years in order to keep a competitive advantage within their market, reduce costs and increase desirability of products in terms of design and quality. These markets have been using industrial robots since 1970's. However, this technology and its following benefits have not been embraced in the construction industry. This may be due to the slower pace of the construction industry tends to adopt technological innovations in general.    \n\n",

					"longDescription": "Farm Dog�s precision agriculture platform is the first comprehensive and standardized system of record for pest and disease management. The platform drives a reduction in pesticide use while minimizing crop loss. Specifically, the platform is an in-field scout workflow tool and grower web dashboard, supported by data analytics. Crowd-sourcing, geo-referencing, and algorithms allow for outbreak prediction and pesticide efficacy testing.  The beta product is being used in Israel and the US, including partnerships with Glades Crop Care (a leading agronomist company), a $100MM farmer, a Monsanto field station, and the University of Florida. In addition, the company was a member of the Farm Bureau�s Data Privacy Advisory Board alongside DuPont, et al, and the company is a graduate of the Microsoft Ventures Accelerator program.\nTwo forces will change the way we grow our food forever.  The first is the consolidation of large agricultural chemical companies into potentially three main players.  Dow and DuPont are merging, Syngenta has been purchased by ChemChina, and Bayer has made a $60B+ offer for Monsanto.  Only BASF is currently sitting on the sidelines.    On the operations side, growers worldwide spend almost $60B on pesticides per year, yet still see 20% to 40% crop loss due to pest and disease.  Due to changing regulations on which pesticides are allowed, increased resistance to pesticides by pest and disease, climate change and international trade bringing new threats to various geographies, pest and disease management will only become harder.    This is the world that Farm Dog is entering. \nOne of our main challenges is which sales channel should we be targeting.  Direct-to-grower?  The local retailer of agriculture chemicals? The wholesale distributor?  The large agriculture chemical company?      To answer this question, we would like you to do a few things first:    (1) Map out the value chain in agriculture chemicals from beginning to end (i.e., from raw material until it gets to the grower).  Within that mapping we would like to know key players, profit pools, and operating levers.    (2) Identify likely effects on each step in the value chain due to consolidation in the industry.     (3) Identify how each stakeholder in the value chain is likely to react to the expected changes.    (4) Build out initial go-to-market for each sales channel.  What is the best way to reach the key players?  What incentives does each require to consider a new product?  How long is the expected sales cycle?    The expectation is that to answer these questions, many interviews will be required (perhaps even on-site visits where possible) with industry players and industry experts.      The agricultural chemicals industry is undergoing a massive shift right now.  We look forward to working with you to identify how best to align with the changes in order to create a positive impact on the bottom-line of growers while driving safe and healthy growing practices for us and the environment. \n",

					"longDescription": "Museums haven't changed much in decades while the safe way we experience the world has, tremendously, especially for the younger generations. Museums understand that and are looking to technology to solve this problem. This is why we started Museloop.  At Museloop, we strive to change the museum visiting experience while allowing museums to finally know their visitors. We started with a game-based experience to address the younger audiences, who are a big focus for museums. They are also early adapters of technology.   Our augmented reality gaming platform allows museums to turn their existing content into a game-based mobile app tour guide. We take the burden off museums, allowing them to focus on the content, while we take care of users and engagement. By creating engaging experiences, we collect vast amounts of quality data on visitor behavior.  The experience we designed puts the art at the front and center and uses the games to deliver content. We built templates of games and a CMS. Once museums put content in, we can immediately generate an app that provides a unique experience  Our SaaS platform offers the perfect solution for any exhibit (permanent or temporary) and museum, from the top tier to the long tail of thousands of museums facing the same challenges with no affordable solutions.   We're live at the three leading museums in Israel and are now in the process of expanding in the US. \n\nPart 1 / The first challenge is conducting a thorough market analysis which involves two aspects - TAM and competitive analysis.  The company has conducted a lot of work on both. There is a slide with hyperlinked logos to all the known competitors and a deck on TAM, recently put together for investors.  The question the company is still struggling with and needs the students� help with is: how to validate the price point? This involves considering museums' willingness to pay and the size of their digital/education budgets on the one hand, and on the other hand, how much the competition charges and for what kind of solutions.  \n\nPart 2 / The second question to address is the ability to scale the company and unit economics. We can easily calculate gross LTV of a client - but what is the cost of acquisition and retention? Develop a unit economics of these factors. Assuming we are not a zero-touch company and have acquisition cost, integration cost and support cost. Does our pricing model make sense? How \"Low-touch\" do we have to be to reach acceptable margins?  This will require benchmark of companies that sell products in the $15-50K/year range and evaluating how their unit economics work.  \n\nPart 3 / Based on the benchmark conducted in part 2, looking at comparable companies that you feel have similar go-to-market strategies and models, we'd like a deeper look into how they started: Who was their first client (small, medium or large client), What country did they start in and how did they expand, how many pilots did they do? How many sales people? Other issues in their client acquisition and go-to-market worth noting. / Make recommendations on the direction the company should take, based on these findings.  \n",

This unique and highly disruptive solution uses an electro-optic scanning device placed at strategic locations such as depot or parking lot gates, gas stations and toll roads to automatically inspect passing vehicles for tire and wheel problems.  / Using Neomatix�s solution helps fleet operators to significantly improve their bottom line, safety, up time (the KPI that checks when an asset, such as a truck or bus, is available for work, as opposed to �down time� when that vehicle is broken down, in the shop, undergoing scheduled maintenance etc.) and carbon footprint by automatically monitoring tires and diagnosing issues such as under inflation, wear, tear, foreign objects, asymmetry, over heating, wheel alignment and more. Our solution can even detect stolen and incompatible tires without installing any component on the vehicle or tires, and avoiding any disturbance to the work routine. \nThe company is active in Brazil, where it currently has 1 big paying customer, and a distribution agreement with a fleet management company. We are in the process of closing a pilot deal with Coca-Cola this month, plan to open a Bizdev office in the US before the end of the year and have recently been selected by Shell Oil as 1 of the top 5 mobility startups in 2016, meaning we will enter Shell�s startup program next year.\nThe basic business model is selling hardware gate scanners (roughly for $15K) and charging a monthly license fee for the tire management software (~$5/month per truck). Leasing options are also available for long term contracts (no upfront fee, slightly higher recurring fees).\n\nThe first part of the challenge is understanding the industry trends and competitive landscape. Start by defining the Pain and Total Addressable Market - Namely, what is the importance of proper tire maintenance, how much do fleets pay due to tire negligence, and what other solutions exist for fleet-level tire management and monitoring. Conduct a SWOT analysis - noting competition, trend and regulation. / Neomatix is currently focused on commercial vehicle fleets in the US, so the challenge is to create a go to market plan. / Start by understanding the product - its features and differentiation. / Identify the competition and the company's competitive edge. / Which potential customers are more likely to enjoy this disruptive solution? Can you name several? How big are they? How do you make a sales deal? What is the cost of acquisition?   This go to market plan should be part of a  strategy for the next 2 years in the US market.

Our assumption claims that for that purpose, medical institutes will need to build  buy platforms like Genoox that accelerate the time for getting genetic insights + reducing cost and overhead for managing and storing genomic data. Thus and following few discussions with medical institutes, we strongly believe in our approach. However, our current challenge is to understand what will be the best method to penetrate in the US. As some of the personalised medicine centers already started to work on some platforms and there is a challenge selling  directly to the provider and not the insurer. \nThus the goal is to build a go to market strategy based on these assumptions or provide alternative assumptions.

While the need to compare and contrast different ETFs exist in the US and currently being met in various forms by a number of services: i.e. etf.com, xtf.com, justETF.com, ETFdb.com, and trackinsight.com; the question remains whether there is room and need for another player.\nAnother important development to keep in mind is one which may provide some backwind to the ETF analysis space: a new Rule finalized by the Department of Labor to address conflicts of interest in retirement advice: �requiring all who provide retirement investment advice to plans, plan fiduciaries and IRAs to abide by a �fiduciary� standard�putting their clients' best interest before their own profits.� https://www.dol.gov/agencies/ebsa/about-ebsa/our-activities/resource-center/fact-sheets/dol-final-rule-to-address-conflicts-of-interest\nAs retirement investment advisors will no longer be able to �push� products they receive distribution incentives for, they will seek to change their business model to direct advisory fee � a fee which will have to be justified with proven added value. ETF analysis platforms may help contribute to such added value.\nYour challenge is:\nA) help the company decide whether to offer BE-RankTM in the US or not, showing a convincing case for it (conducting competitor analysis and surveying investment advisors, professionals, and plan sponsors could be very helpful).\nB) in the event that the advice is NOT to offer BE-RankTM in the US, please suggest an alternative product which could make sense for the company to develop for the US market.\nC) identify the potential market size and build the go-to-market plan for whatever product you recommend the company offer (BE-RankTM US or another product altogether) using a b2b or b2b2c strategy (since the company�s available resources for marketing are more suitable for targeted b2b or b2b2c rather than b2c which usually are more expensive to reach directly in masses).\nD) if time allows, draft a Pitch-Deck for Series-A investment of $20 million.\n",

					"longDescription": "SCREEMO helps brands to engage on-the-go and on-location consumers by using interactive experiences that run in retail stores, QSRs, cinema and etc.  SCREEMO's interactive experience creates a call to action that drive up sales on the customer's mobile device such as impulse buying or social network activities. (Check out our Showreel video YouTube)\nSCREEMO�s Saas platform allows content creators and designers to create their own interactive mobile-to-screen experience without the need of any developer or the need to deploy complex infrastructure. The interactive experience they will create will work in any store or location on the globe and will provide the marketing managers real-time analytics and control on their interactive campaign. Using SCREEMO's platforms shortens time-to-market and makes engaging your customers with an interactive experience more affordable and effective.\nSCREEMO is a patent pending and an award-winning start-up launched in Tel Aviv in 2013 (Check out the winning pitch @ MWC Shanghai YouTube). SCREEMO operates in APAC, Europe and North America. Since its inception, the company has partnered with well-known global companies including Microsoft, The Coca-Cola Company, Deutsche Telekom, SAP and more.\n\nAbout the Challenge:\nBased on our experience with SCREEMO's products and our clients' feedback, SCREEMO is about to launch in Q1, 2017 a new version and offering of our product that will allow us to provide our clients even shorter time-to-market, reduced costs and better interactive experiences for our client's consumers. The new version of SCREEMO's product will now be available directly to the marketing managers with a complete library of interactive, pre-made content and a dedicated user friendly interface that will allow them to simply brand and customize the chosen interactive experience, based on their needs. By doing so, SCREEMO cuts out the content creators/designers from the creative process and allows clients to get the content faster and at a more affordable price. SCREEMO�s new version of the product will also run on newer technologies and will allow multi-consumers' engagement to improve better retention and conversion. \nThe go-to-market approach of the new version is focused on the QSR segment in the US market. The QSR segment has been chosen as the first segment for the launch since it provides optimal conditions to engage consumers with interactive experiences at waiting areas to drive up sales and as a result of the high adaptation rate of digital signage technologies. \nThe goal of the team will be to create a business plan, a detailed go-to-market strategy, and a recommended pricing model for the above, based on a market research that will include  primary research (collecting data directly from the company customers and channels) and a secondary research (using already published research and existing research data). The research will be focused on: The Industry � the entire picture of what is happening in the environment, industry trends, shifts and changes; The target customers � identify their demographics and psychographics; The customer needs and buying patterns; The competitors � strengths and weaknesses of SCREEMO's product competition; and etc.\nIn order to achieve the goal, the student will work closely with SCREEMO management team, and will have an access to some of SCREEMO's prestige customers (such as Coca-Cola, Microsoft, Dominos, etc.) according to the needs.\n",

					"longDescription": "SecBI provides organizations with full-scope incident detection, including multiple users, domains, assets and more, while reducing the time to detect threats. We combine the latest advances in unsupervised machine learning to mimic the work of an expert cybersecurity analyst, with log data from the web proxy. Other detection tools are time-consuming to deploy and may generate thousands of alerts, but don�t offer insight that allows for careful planning of next steps. We detect more with less noise by reporting only qualified incidents, rather than just spurious alerts. Our technology surfaces internal and external entities within a compromised network and eliminates the often complex work left for analysts. SecBI was founded in 2014 by a team of industry veterans, and is backed by JVP.\nSecBI started off by addressing the large enterprise market.  It's initial Pilots were with very large organizations, with over 100,000 employees.  This included financial institutions, telecommunication providers, and consumer manufacturing enterprises.  Due to long sales cycles with these very large enterprises, SecBI is looking for alternative options in market penetration, and the SMB market is one of them. Specifically, enterprises with ~20,000-80,000 employees.  These customers should have faster sales cycles, and possibly higher needs, due to lower budgets for Cyber Security services and experts. \nSecBI�s challenge, is to understand the attractiveness of SecBI�s product, for SMB organizations, specifically, organizations with over $1B in revenues (approximately F2,000). Analyze the competitive landscape, the biz logig etc.  These organizations would have security systems deployed, a security team, and this team probably faces the challenges SecBI solves.  As part of the challenge, SecBI would like the following (or similar) questions to be addressed through directly engaging with relevant SMBs:\n1. Do you face the problem described by SecBI?\n2. Are you looking for solution for this problem in 2017?\n3. How much would you pay for a system that would solve this problem?\nBased on your research, develop a market penetration plan. If your research demonstrates that the SMB market is not compelling enough, recommend an alternative market and develop a plan for that market.\n",

					"longDescription": "The Intensix platform is a pioneering platform of analytical tools that provides operational, financial and clinical benefits to all layers of ICU {intensive care Units) management and staff. Intensix utilizes high volume and high velocity analytics to identify real-time patterns in physiological data that predict a deterioration in the patient�s condition. By providing clinicians with early prediction of deteriorations, clinicians will be able to intervene sooner and consequently prevent unnecessary complications, reduce mortality and ultimately, save lives. Deployed as a standalone app or integrated into an existing solution, the platform harnesses the vast amount of available ICU data to deliver highly accurate predictive clinical analytics that provide hospital management and medical personnel with the preemptive information they require to better manage the ICU floor. The Intensix solution is expected to reduce the average length of stay, a benefit that directly lowers the hospitals� costs and frees up revenue-producing ICU beds for other patients.\nIntensix provides decision support tool for early predictions of deterioration in critical care and high acuity areas at the hospital.     Since our inception on January 2015, our development team that consists of top notch researchers and mathematicians, devoted themselves to data ingestion, developing a knowledge system and building the prediction algorithms. As part of our R&D efforts, we completed 3 successful retrospective studies and are now in the middle of prospective, live, proof concept trials at Mayo Clinic and Tel Aviv Medical Center.     Now, that most of the analytic work is behind us,  we are facing the biggest challenge of all:  Productization.\nWhere do we display a life a threatening alert in the ICU?   Who do we notify when a patient is stable enough and can be discharged?   What do we do when we know it is time to get a patient off antibiotic?     In other words, how do we turn this great technology into a commercialized product?     Real-estate in in ICU is tough, the patient bedside environment consists of numerous medical devices, monitors, electronic medical records and so on. There are constant alarms and alerts going off, clinical staff is required to navigate between the different alerts, data outputs and most importantly, treating their patients. What type of new data output can we provide that would help them carry their tasks in a more efficient way? Where should that data be displayed? How do we build our system in a way that a life threatening alert is not just another faded sound in the sea of warnings in an ICU?     Inside the patient room in the ICU, an Intensix alert could populate one of the following:  1. Patient monitor  2. Standalone app on the bedside computer that is used for documentation  3. Embedded as part of the EMR (electronic medical layer) at the bedside computer  4. New form factor  mobile device either dedicated per room or per clinicians    Separately, in order to provide a complete operational, financial and clinical tool to all layers of ICU management and staff, Intensix would need to provide a management console that will help clinicians get a sense of their unit status in a glance. A multi patient view.    For every one of these scenarios, we need to understand who is the target audience (in and outside the unit), where is the data stored, presented. How do we handle patient confidentiality on devices that are not fixed to the ICU (e.g. mobile, laptops etc.) and what are the business alliances we would need to form with different EMR vendors and monitoring companies.     Are you up for the challenge?   \n",

					"shortDescription": "marketing plan for Woosh that will be deployed in Miami Beach in early 2017",
					"longDescription": "Overview-\nRethink the way we drink!\nOur Vision- Our vision is to change the way people consume water while they are on the go to sustainable and eco-friendly way!\nAs public drinking fountains are no longer perceived as a high quality, clean water source- both bottled water and sugary beverages consumption are constantly increasing. The disadvantages are clear: we drink less water due to its price, polluting the environment tremendously and harm our bodies with sugary beverages. \nThe solution: Offering the public a true alternative- equal by quality and affordable by price. In one word: Woosh!\nWoosh smart water stations are designed to provide a high volume of chilled, pure and great tasting water in public spaces. Combined with first of its kind bottle cleaning system to rinse personal bottles and ongoing meticulous maintenance, Woosh stations offer a genuine alternative to bottled water. A network of stations will make cool, high quality water accessible to the public in a fraction of a price.\n\nThe product- One of its kind smart water station that both fills and rinses any reusable bottle. The station is fully computerized and operates using a touch screen with multiple language modes enabling tourists and local residents to use it easily. In addition, it tracks member's water consumption and calculate how many plastic bottles a single member, as well was the whole Woosh community, has saved so far! There are three types of stations: Mobile, Outdoor and Indoor. Have we mentioned the award winning design?\nFoundation- Our story begins with Itay (co-founder and CEO of woosh), who went out for a stroll with his first born on a sunny summer day. The water bottle they brought from home was long ago finished, and his son was thirsty, so Itay set out looking for a place to fill it up.\nHe searched for a clean and safe source of water, preferably cold, but couldn�t find one. Buying a disposable plastic bottle was completely out of the question (call him green if you will). That�s when it hit him, the idea for safe, reliable, plastic free water on the go.\nThe seed for Woosh was planted that day... and the company was thus founded in 2010.\nExperience- Woosh stations had a successful pilot in The City of Tel Aviv, Israel! Our current ongoing projects are station network at Sinclair community college (Dayton) and City of Miami Beach! As a young and constantly evolving company, we are open to new ideas- and YOUR new ideas might take shape at one of our ongoing projects!\n\nThe Challenge: \nA) Miami Beach Challenge (B2C)\nWoosh challenges Cornell's students to create a marketing plan for Woosh that will be deployed in Miami Beach in early 2017! Can you cause the entire city to develop new drinking habits? Can you sell not only a product, but a way of life? \nRequirements- You are in charge of our upcoming launch in Miami Beach! The marketing plan must include a cohesive promotion concept for the network based on thorough market analysis you will perform. Your final product would be a ready to execute A-Z marketing plan, which includes marketing strategy, the promotional messages, and marketing channels. \nTargets- The plan's targets:\n� Raise awareness about the project- the entire city should know who we are!  \n� Attract as many users as possible to the stations.\n� Encourage residents to subscribe to our membership program.\n� Establish a habit, not just a fad.\nYour market- You are targeting millions of tourists of diverse nationalities, 91,700 permanent residents and thousands of seasonal residents. By marketing analysis you will perform, you will decide which segments (age? Origin? Pedestrians? Unprofessional athletes? etc.) hold most potential to be future consumers and adjust the marketing program to them. \nChallenges-\n� Tourists � How will we reach this constantly changing audience that embodies huge financial potential (7,238,000 overnight visitors!), not only on launch week? \n� Seasonal Residents- this group of 23,801 potential members of the ever evolving Woosh community are seasonal resident. How will you convince them to subscribe?\n� Additional sales- Woosh sells reusable bottles and provides its members a Woosh Tag with which they can use at the stations. Where and how will we sell them?\n� Creativity- Demonstrate creativity! We are looking for non-conventional ideas, surprise us!\nCompetitive landscape � Kiosks, vending machines, convenience stores and any other business selling bottled beverages (up to 1.5 liters) on the go. \n_Please note: The marketing plan must not include negative messages regarding tap water, as Woosh would not like to encourage the use of bottled water and multipacks at home- carbon emissions will multiply!\n",

Mobideo is headquartered in Israel, and has presence in US and Europe, with dozens of customers in all large industries, such as Aerospace, Oil and Gas, Energy, Healthcare, Telecom and Defense.  Mobideo�s solutions have been supporting Industrial assets and applications across the assets lifecycle, from installation commissioning,start-ups, to retrofits (a significant modernization of industrial equipment for example, which is a very complex and expensive process) and decommissioning.    Mobideo's vision is that a completely new software paradigm of engaging and reporting in real-time at the most granular level of organizational know-how is necessary to support Industrial�Grade Service Operations Management and the \"people side\" of the Industrial InternetIoT.    Mobideo is the only solution focused on the People side of the Industrial Internet. Mobideo exploits the convergence of Industrial InternetInternet of Things (IoT), machines and processes, along with big-data analytics and mobile technologies to optimize service throughout an asset's entire lifecycle.\nMobideo has reached a very critical milestone, whereby its product maturity, the market trends and customer tractions are now requiring a new approach for scaling the business.  The business requires new resources and capabilities, with a strong brand to support Mobideo in it�s mission to revolutionize Industrial Service Operations Management, thus transforming a multi-billion $ industry, in the Industrial Internet age.    Mobideo will begin a strategic fundraising round in Q1 2017, whereby it plans to reach out to key industrial players, Strategic players and large venture capital funds focusing on Industrial Internet in order to raise significant growth capital to support its growth activities and further invest in its technology and innovations.    Your challenge will be to support Mobideo in creating a compelling story, and fundraising investor�s presentation to attract the leading investors in the field to take part in Mobideo�s vision.    Few aspects to consider regarding this challenge:  -- Mobideo is creating a new category - Service Operations Management - which is currently   not addressed by other players. Very similar to the creation of the iPhone when Smartphones were not a category yet.   -- This creates a challenge in positioning and evaluating the market potential.  -- Furthermore it creates a difficulty to assess the Total Addressable market, the comparable categories as well as competitor landscape.  --As the Industrial Internet is booming with hype, there is a lot of noise and sometimes little content.   Mobideo is in a unique position as it has a mature technology solving a real and painful problem.   Thus Mobideo wants to be positioned as an Innovative Industrial Internet player (hype), however with strong track record and solid product offering (mature), which is a challenge when selling to investors.  \nThe investor presentation should include the following, among other topics:\no Market size\no Competition\no Value Proposition \no Funding requirements\no Financial projections \n- Valuation\n",
